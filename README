Given two matrices A and B. The task is to multiply matrix A and matrix B recursively. If matrix A and matrix B are not multiplicative compatible, then generate output “Not Possible”.

In Recursive Matrix Multiplication, we implement three loops of Iteration through recursive calls. The inner most Recursive call of multiplyMatrix() is to iterate k (col1 or row2). The second recursive call of multiplyMatrix() is to change the columns and the outermost recursive call is to change rows.
